Individual side project - still a work in early progress. <br>
This is an app that will let users log in, put in monthly costs and share monthly view with family members. 

To be implemented (hopefully!):
Allow users to choose how much % each family member should pay out of the total monthly cost, and inform how much they owe each other.
Allow family members to see stats over previous months.
